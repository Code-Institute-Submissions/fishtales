# FishTales - Fly Fishing Blog

This is my fourth milestone project with Code Institute. FishTales is an Django blog application built for people who enjoy fly fishing. It is targeted towards people fishing in Sm√•land, Sweden. 
The purpose of this site is to allow users to share their fishing stories, upload photos of possible catches as well as comment and like on other posts.
